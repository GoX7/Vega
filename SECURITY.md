## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, responsibly disclose it by sending an email to:

📧 **gox7.sec@gmail.com** *(or your real email here)*

Include as much detail as possible:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact or affected components
- Optional: a proposed patch or workaround

We aim to respond within **48 hours**, and to release a fix within **7 days** depending on severity.

---

## Disclosure Process

1. Confirm and reproduce the issue privately
2. Coordinate a patch if necessary
3. Publish an advisory + patch release
4. Credit the reporter (if agreed)

---

## Out of Scope

Please note that we **do not** treat the following as security issues:
- Denial of Service (DoS) via malformed inputs (unless critical)
- Use of Vega in unsafe ways (e.g., exposing raw inputs to `template.HTML`)
- Vulnerabilities in user code or dependencies outside Vega

Thanks for helping us keep Vega safe and secure!
